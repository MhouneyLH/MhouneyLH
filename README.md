# Hey there! ðŸŒ±

I'm Lucas from Thuringia, Germany, and I'm currently studying for my master's degree in Software Engineering in Hagenberg, Upper Austria. I'm a passionate Software Engineer who loves learning new things, solving problems, and taking on new challenges. I'm looking forward to working on interesting projects.

My current focus is on Software Architecture, Backend development and DevOps, but I'm also interested in mobile development and Network Engineering / System Administration.

I'm always open to Open Source contributions and new projects!
